# algorithms
Generic implementations of popular algorithms:
# Graphing algorithms
- Dijkstra's algorithm, used to find lowest cost route from A to B
- Breadth First Search, used to find route with fewest nodes along the graph from A to B
# Dynamic Programming
- knapsack, a dynamic programming solution to the 0-1 knapsack problem
# Nearest Neighbors
- K Nearest Neighbors, simple algorithm for recommendations
